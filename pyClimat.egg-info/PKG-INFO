# pyClimat
----------
Climat python package for analysising GCM model output and visualization. The package is written in a function based 
(would be pivoted to OPP style in future development). The analysis module features climate variable extraction 
and estimation of statistical long-term means and difference. Statistical tools like PCA or EOF analysis are included for specific 
estimates and many other classical methods like testing, OLS estiates, etc. 

## installation 
-------------
Can be installed by chećking the dependencies in pyClimat.yml (But it will be compiled afterwards for easy installatoin)

The package would also be uploaded on pypi (which can be installed with pip install pyClimat or with the -e flag to install in edit mode)



## Documentation 
-------------
The docs folder contains all the dist for the documentation compilation (cd docs; make html)
The direct stable link would be shared shortly


## Examples
------------

This package was adopted for all the visualization in the research study by Boateng et. al 2022 ( Impacts of surface uplift on regional climate)
The scripts can be located in the folder [Alps](./examples/Alps/)
